UnerringMist: Banshee! Causes fear affects which have various effects, extra roundtimes, lower willpower, running away, and last level would be coma or heart attack =P
UnerringMist: of course with these new status effects a new skill is needed. Psychology to heal those phobias =P
UnerringMist: and that led to the idea of maybe having a skill parapsychology for future releases...
UnerringMist: parapsychology can be used to get rid of ghosts without using a proton pack...and since the ghostbusters had doctorates in parapsychology....
