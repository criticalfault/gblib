	[for every 10 more they roll do another d10, so if it returns 32, roll 3d10 {Random(28)+3)} if they roll 73, 7d10 {random(63)+7}. I'd do a big case statement or if you can figure out some kind of function for calculating it. Win for you! The healing fuction we have wont let you heal past 100 so let the whole number it generates through.]
