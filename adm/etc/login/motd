--%^BOLD%^RED%^EQUIPMENT%^RESET%^

Protonpacks, traps, and pkemeters should all be fixed now. They are using
add_action and I kicked all the known bugs associated with add_action.  Things
to note are:

- Use of add_action does not automagically take into accout player status, or 
  command timers. These are things you are going to have to do on your own.
- There may still be bugs in place left from the removal of command_d please
  continue to track your bugs as you find them.

--%^BOLD%^RED%^BUG TRACKING%^RESET%^

We are setting a bug tracking solution as I have never like ANYTHING that was
a mud solution.  We'll need a mud solution once we have players but having a 
web based interface with users and forms will be much nicer while we do our
development leading up to alpha and beta.

--%^BOLD%^RED%^WWW.GBMUD.COM%^RESET%^

We have a word press blog!  Its something I amuse my self with thinking that
people will just stumble accross it but I figured we could use it to keep track
of the things we are doing etc.  Let me know if you want to have an account
setup for you and I will get it done. Having an account will also allow you to
see the private staff only posts that I will be posting with my progress on
stuff.

--%^BOLD%^RED%^WELCOME NEW FOLK%^RESET%^

I wanted to say welcome welcom new staff of gbmud. I am happy you are here
and hope we can all work together to make a kick ass mud for the 200 or so
people that still mud :).  In all seriousness thank you for your support
lets make something awesome.

Emraef.
